**Company Overview:**

Swiggy, a well-known Indian online food ordering and delivery platform, was founded in August 2014 by Sriharsha Majety, Nandan Reddy, and Rahul Jaimini. Headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, Swiggy has rapidly expanded its services to cover over 580 cities across India as of July 2023. It operates as an online platform connecting customers with a wide range of restaurants and eateries, offering convenient and reliable food delivery services.

Before Swiggy, both customers and restaurants faced significant challenges. Restaurants often didn't offer home delivery, leading to problems for people who couldn't commute or spend time dining out due to their busy schedules. Customers were limited to nearby restaurants with limited menus, resulting in restricted dining choices. Traditional ordering processes were cumbersome, involving phone calls, potential miscommunications, and long waiting times. These challenges were particularly problematic for corporate employees who barely had time to cook and needed quick, proper meals.

Swiggy emerged as a bridge to remove these hurdles, connecting nearby restaurants with customers and making food delivery easy and efficient.
