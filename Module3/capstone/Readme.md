# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Welcome to the captivating realm of the "Product Dissection for top leading Platforms" project. In this engaging endeavor, participants embark on a voyage of exploration and design, unraveling the intricate tapestry of schema architecture that underpins leading digital platforms. By meticulously dissecting the core features, innovative solutions, and real-world challenges of these platforms, participants gain profound insights into the art of crafting effective data structures. Through a blend of comprehensive research, creative schema design, and insightful presentations, this project not only showcases technical prowess but also underscores the pivotal role of data architecture in shaping the functionality and success of modern digital giants.

This project's essence lies in its fusion of technical acumen and creative expression. Participants not only dissect the DNA of top platforms but also architect elegant schema designs that reflect the platforms' essence. By bridging the realms of technology, user experience, and strategic decision-making, this project empowers participants to craft data-driven solutions that resonate with the evolving needs of a digital age.

# DELIVERABLES

Students needs to submit the following:

1. **Google Doc - Research on the Project:**
   Students are expected to submit a Google Doc that serves as a repository for their research and analysis of the chosen top leading platform.
2. **Presentation Video:**
   Each student is required to create an individual presentation video. The video should not exceed the designated time limit (e.g., 20 minutes) and must effectively communicate the student's understanding of the project. During the video presentation, students are expected to share their screen, showcasing their presentation slides while maintaining a speaker view. The presentation should cover their insights, findings, and personal contributions to the project.
3. **Technical Documentation:**
   Students should prepare an individual technical document that encapsulates their approach and contributions to the project.
