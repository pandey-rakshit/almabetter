# **Project Description**

The World Bank EdStats All Indicator Query holds over 4,000 internationally comparable indicators that describe education access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, and expenditures.The indicators cover the education cycle from pre-primary to vocational and tertiary education and also holds learning outcome data from international and regional learning assessments (e.g. PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS), equity data from household surveys, and projection/attainment data. Explore and analyze the data to identify variation of indicators across the globe, which countries are more alike and different. Feel free to add more extensive analyses and details.
